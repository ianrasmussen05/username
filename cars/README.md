# In this program, I will be making cars.sh and be making a my_old_cars file
# From there I will stage it and then commit it into my repository on github.com

# In the cars.sh, it will ask the user for the year, the make, and the model of a car which then 
# appends it into the My_old_cars file. Sort the cars by year.
